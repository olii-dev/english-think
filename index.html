            <h2>What is 'Think'?</h2>
            <p>My product is called <span class="highlight">‘Think’</span>. Think is for when you want to be creative but don’t want to do the work to be creative. With Think, there is no need to be creative (apart from thinking)! It fits perfectly into the technology category.</p>
            <p>My target for this product is developers, journalists, artists, <span class="highlight">anyone</span> who has to be creative in their job, or just anyone who creates stuff for hobbies. My product is needed because people always say they have no time in their day, now they can! Anyone can use this product at work, school, home, anywhere!</p>
            <p>The potential market is so high for this type of product, we are predicting one million in revenue just in the first year! This is based on some questions we asked the community on our website.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <p>Think is made of a smooth, metallic shell with a sci-fi movie look. Think has a battery that lasts so long, you only have to replace it once a year! Think also includes an AI chip that is capable of real-time thought analysis. The screen on Think is ultra-thin, with the screen being 3 millimeters, 6.47 times smaller than the width of the five cent Australian coin. That is just some of the amazing hardware that creates Think, now for the software.</p>
            <p>Think uses cloud computing to process thoughts into whatever format you want, from mp3's, to videos, Think has got it all. You're probably thinking, 'this product can make what I think exist within a few seconds, but how can I see what it has created?' Well think no more, for Think uses a sleek website where all of your thoughts are accessible almost instantly.</p>

            <h2>The Story Behind Think</h2>
            <p>The idea of Think came to me a few years ago when I was so tired of spending hours trying to craft the perfect assignment for mathematics. I remember the exact words I said, "Imagine if there was a product where you thought of anything, and within a few seconds it was right in front of you." So there I was a few weeks later, starting a very long but pleasing journey to create this idea I had. At first I thought I could never do it, but the more hours I put into it, the further I got.</p>
            <p>I started the project with not much push because I thought it was just an idea, little did I know, that <span class="highlight">was not</span> the case. I ended up putting so much effort into this product that I missed 2 months of school at one point. I actually recall it, I would wake up at six in the morning, eat breakfast, work tirelessly all day until about eight in the afternoon, until I went to eat dinner, and that repeated for two months! I was too tired I took one month in hiatus from making Think.</p>
            <p>I got back to it a month later and worked on it, not day and night, but whenever I had spare time. After a long while of this, I was finally done, now I just had to think of the name for this product I have created. I knew product names were crucial, and I only had one shot to get this right. I thought, and thought, and thought. Then it hit me, Apple, Bing, PlayStation, these are all simple names, but they are very popular. I went with Think, it's so simple, fun, entertaining, and makes people want to know more!</p>

            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
            <p>So, now you know how good Think is, you know how it came to be, what are you waiting for?</p>
            <p>Actually, there is one more thing. We have released it to some people to test, the results were insane. In fact, the results were so unexpected, even I was shocked. We sent Think to 100 people, with one condition, they had to use think to do the creative work for them, at work, home, wherever and whatever. One user, has actually created an artwork that sold for ten thousand Australian dollars! On average, over one day Think was used 9 times in one day. The largest category on average was music, being 6 out of the 9 times think was used in one day.</p>
